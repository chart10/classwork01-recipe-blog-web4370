      <h3>Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</h3>
      In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high
      concentration of nutrients for the calories they contain, we created a
      Recipe Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the recipes that
      are especially rich in particular nutrients. The following chart shows the
      nutrients for which 15-Minute Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad is either an
      excellent, very good, or good source (below the chart you will find a
      table that explains these qualifications). If a nutrient is not listed in
      the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the recipe doesn't contain
      it. It simply means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient
      amount or concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this
      recipe's in-depth nutritional profile that includes values for dozens of
      nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, very good, or good -
      please use the link below the chart.) To read this chart accurately,
      you'll need to glance back up to see the ingredients used in the recipe
      and the number of serving sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient
      ratings are based on a single serving. For example, if a recipe makes 4
      servings, you would be receiving the nutrient amounts listed in the chart
      by eating 1/4th of the combined ingredients found in the recipe. Now,
      returning to the chart itself, you can look next to the nutrient name in
      order to find the nutrient amount it offers, the percent Daily Value (DV%)
      that this amount represents, the nutrient density that we calculated for
      this recipe and nutrient, and the rating we established in our rating
      system. For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government
      standards for food labeling that are found in the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration's "Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling." Read more
      background information and details of our rating system.
